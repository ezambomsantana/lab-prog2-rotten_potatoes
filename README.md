# lab-prog2-rotten_potatoes

Repository with the code of the Rotten Potatoes Application from the SaaS book

## Running

The application is ready to start, just run the command 

rails server


## Tests

In the class we will see how to run unit tests with RSPEC, a Ruby test library. To run the tests we will need to install some gems in the project GEMFILE:

#### RSPEC: The test library that we will use - this gem must be added in the group :test
gem rspec-rails

#### TheMovieDB - A Wrapper to the TMDb API
gem themoviedb

After adding the two gems, run bundle install.
